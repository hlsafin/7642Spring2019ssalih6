The dependencies required to run the files are as follows, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, gym and Numpy.

To see the final model after training for 135,000 games or episodes on a particular seed to reproduce  a graphs in paper, just run "python testing.py" in terminal . You may wish to uncomment env.render() to display each game, otherwise it will play 200 games, and output a plot of the scores of each game. 

If you  run training.ipynb, you may wish to change the seed_value. However, if you want to reproduce some of the graphs in paper and get same model , keep the seed value the same.
