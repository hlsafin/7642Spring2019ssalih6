The only dependencies you need to run these codes are as follows:
Matplotlib and Numpy

Afterwards, go to command line , type and enter: "python figure3.py" ,
This will do the first experiment done in Sutton's paper, and after
completion you should see a plot similar to Figure 3 Expect a wait time
of 6-8 minutes depending on your computer

For the second experiment run this on command line: "python
figure4\_and\_figure5.py", This will do the second experiment and result
in a graph that is similar to Figure 4 and Figure 5 after completion.
*Note this will require more time. Expect a 20-30 minutes wait time*
